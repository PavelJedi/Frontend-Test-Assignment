# Star Wars Character Explorer

This app lets you explore Star Wars characters using a sleek and responsive UI. Dive into details for each character and filter characters by various criteria.

## Tools Used

- **Redux Toolkit**: This is a powerful tool to manage the app's state. It simplifies writing Redux logic, lets us manage the state efficiently, and comes with tools to reduce boilerplate code.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client that's both lightweight and configurable. It's used to handle all API requests to fetch data from the Star Wars API, offering an easy-to-use API and automatic transformations of JSON data.
- **React-Bootstrap**: A widely-used UI framework that provides a set of responsive, mobile-first components. It's used here for rapid UI development that's consistent and works well on all device sizes.
- **Reselect**: This library is used for creating memoized selector functions, enhancing performance by preventing unnecessary rerenders, especially useful when computing derived data from the Redux store.
